## Calibrating the head tracker

- Every time you mount the head tracker to a new position you **need** to follow the following steps in order to calibrate the head tracker.

1. Position your head looking straight ahead at your screen.
2. Press the button located on top of the head tracker for longer than 1 second.
3. Position you head again to look down at the floor.
4. Short-press the calibration button (< 1s).

- Now the head tracker is calibrated for the specific position it is currently mounted. It is recommended you do follow these steps every time you start a test or take the headphones off.

* **If the tracker starts drifting after a while, you can always press the button shortly (< 1s) to re-centre.**

- Locate the position indicator in the top-centre of the Max patch. This will show you when to reposition your head if it goes out of the +/- 7Â° range.

- The green indicator tells you that that your head is in the central position.

- The two red arrows will indicate in which direction to rotate your head such that it is in the central position again.
